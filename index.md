Implementation of the well-known game
usually played on a vertical board of 7 columns by 6 rows,
where 2 players take turns in dropping counters in a column.
the first player to get four of his counters
in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row, wins the game.
if neither player has won after 42 moves, then the game is drawn.

The game engine is written in C++ and based on the [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) algorithm.
